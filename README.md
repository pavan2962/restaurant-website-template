The restaurant industry is experiencing a significant shift towards digitization and online engagement. In response to this evolving landscape, this project introduces the development of a dynamic restaurant website leveraging HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The existing system relies predominantly on offline methods, lacking a dedicated online presence. The proposed system aims to address this deficiency by offering an intuitive and feature-rich website. Key functionalities include an interactive menu display, an efficient reservation system, a seamless online ordering platform, and a user-friendly content management system. The primary objective of this project is to enhance the restaurant's online visibility, streamline operations, and boost revenue by providing a comprehensive online platform that caters to both customers and restaurant staff. This report outlines the development process, highlights key features, and discusses the potential impact of this digital transformation on the restaurant's success in an increasingly competitive market.
Furthermore, it examines the technological choices made during development, security measures implemented, and future scalability considerations, providing a holistic view of this transformative initiative.
